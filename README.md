# LUMEN Engineering 2021 - Smart soil probe

This project was made for LUMEN Engineering competition held in Zagreb 2021.

The idea behind the smart soil probe is that the probe measures useful soil parameters, specifically
humidity and temperature but also it measures environmental parameters such as humidity,
temperature, light intensity and air pressure. The probe sends the measured data via LoRa
protocol to the receiver (computer) that graphically displays the measured data for analyzeing.
